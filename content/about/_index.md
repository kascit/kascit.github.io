Hey there! 👋 I'm **Dhanur**, a person who writes code and occasionally it works.

## The Origin Story

Look, I'm not gonna feed you some polished narrative about "always being passionate about technology since age 5." Truth is, I fell into coding like most of us did - I wanted to make something, Googled how to do it, and suddenly it's 3 AM and I'm knee-deep in Stack Overflow tabs.

Fast forward a few years of breaking things (and sometimes fixing them), and here we are.

## What I Actually Do

- 💻 **Backend Stuff**: Wrangling Java and Spring Boot to make APIs that don't fall over. Sometimes they even handle production traffic without crying.
- ☁️ **Cloud Things**: Fighting with AWS until it does what I want. Docker containers that refuse to die. Kubernetes configs that I definitely understand (I don't).
- 🐧 **Linux Maximalist**: I use Arch btw. Unironically. Send help.
- 🌐 **Open Source**: Contributing when I can, creating tools for the two other people who have this exact niche problem.

## My Tech Stack

### Languages I Pretend to Know

Java • Python • Rust (still learning) • Go (when I'm feeling brave) • JavaScript (reluctantly) • Bash (excessively)

### Backend Frameworks

Spring Boot • Hibernate • Node.js (for side projects that die quickly)

### Cloud & Infrastructure

AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS) • Docker • Kubernetes • Terraform • GitHub Actions

### Databases

PostgreSQL • MySQL • MongoDB • Redis (for when I want to feel fast)

### Daily Drivers

Arch Linux • Neovim (yes, I'm that person) • tmux • Git • Various terminal emulators I switch between monthly

## What Actually Drives Me

Honestly? A mix of curiosity, stubbornness, and the satisfaction of finally getting that green checkmark in CI after 47 failed attempts.

I believe in:

- **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves fast, and so should we
- **Clean Code**: Write code that humans can understand
- **Automation**: If you do it twice, automate it
- **Open Source**: Sharing knowledge benefits everyone
- **Documentation**: Code without docs is incomplete

## My Journey

Started coding in college, fell in love with backend development and Linux. Spent countless hours debugging, learning, and building. Now I'm sharing what I've learned through this blog.

### Highlights

- 🎓 Computer Science graduate
- 💼 Backend Engineer with focus on Java and Spring ecosystem
- 🏆 Active on LeetCode and competitive programming platforms
- 📝 Writing technical content to help others learn
- 🔧 Building open source tools and contributing to projects

## When I'm Not Coding

- 🎮 Gaming (strategy games and RPGs)
- 📚 Reading (sci-fi, tech books, and blogs)
- 🎵 Listening to music (lo-fi and synthwave while coding)
- 🏃 Staying active and exploring outdoors
