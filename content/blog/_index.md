This is where I document my journey through the chaos of modern software development. Some posts are meticulously researched deep-dives into infrastructure and code patterns. Others are just me venting about why Docker decided to stop working on a random Tuesday. Consider it part technical guide, part digital therapy session. Either way, you might learn something useful—or at least feel better knowing you're not alone in your struggles with technology.
