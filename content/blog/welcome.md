Welcome! You've stumbled upon yet another developer blog that'll probably be abandoned in 3-6 months. But hey, optimism!

## Why This Exists

I was tired of having solutions living rent-free in my brain or scattered across 47 different `.md` files with names like `notes_final_ACTUAL_v3.md`. So I figured, why not put them somewhere public where:

1. Future me can find them when I inevitably forget how I fixed that one bug
2. Maybe someone else Googles the exact same error message at 2 AM
3. I can pretend I'm "building my personal brand" (whatever that means)

## What You'll Find Here

Expect a chaotic mix of:

- **Technical stuff I figured out**: Tutorials, walkthroughs, and "here's how I fixed this annoying problem"
- **Things I broke**: Because we learn more from failures than successes (or so I tell myself)
- **Hot takes**: Occasionally I'll have opinions about tech stuff. They might even be correct.
- **Project deep dives**: When I actually finish something worth talking about

## The Vibe

This isn't gonna be a super polished, corporate-speak tech blog. It's more like... technical documentation but with personality? Think less "10 Best Practices for Enterprise Java" and more "I spent 3 hours debugging this and you won't believe what the solution was."

## Consistency? Never Heard of Her

I'll post when I have something worth saying. Could be weekly, could be once every three months when I finally fix a bug that's been haunting me. No schedules, no pressure, just vibes.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by. Stick around if you want to see a developer figure things out in public.
