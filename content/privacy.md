## About This Website

**dhanur.me** is a personal site owned and operated by Dhanur. It is not part of any company. Data collection is minimal and only for comments, security, and analytics. No personal data is sold.

## Cookies

- **Giscus** (comments) uses cookies/session storage when you opt to comment via GitHub.
- **GitHub** may set auth cookies when you log in to comment.
- **Google Analytics (GA4)** is enabled via `gtag` to measure usage; it sets analytics cookies unless you block them.

## Hosting

The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. GitHub may process server logs (e.g., IP address, user agent) for security and abuse prevention. See [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Comments

- Comments run through **[Giscus](https://giscus.app)**, backed by GitHub Discussions.
- If you comment, you authenticate with GitHub; your GitHub username/avatar become public with your comment.
- Comment content is stored on GitHub. GitHub’s privacy terms apply.
- More info: [GitHub Privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), [Giscus Privacy](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md)

## Analytics

- **Google Analytics (GA4)**: enabled via `gtag` to measure aggregate usage (page views, device type, referrers, coarse location). Data is processed by Google per their policies. You can block GA cookies, use a browser blocker, or the GA opt-out add-on.

## External Links

Links out of this site (e.g., GitHub, Giscus, newsletters) are covered by their own policies. Please review those before using them.

## What We Collect (minimal)

- **Server logs** (via GitHub Pages): IP, user agent, timestamps for security/ops.
- **Comments (optional)**: Your GitHub handle/avatar and comment text if you choose to post via Giscus.
- **Analytics**: GA4 metrics as described above; no user-level profiling by this site.

## Your Choices & Rights

- Don’t comment if you prefer not to share your GitHub handle.
- Clear/block cookies to limit third-party storage.
- For GitHub/Giscus data (comments, logs), contact GitHub per their policy or delete your GitHub account/content.
- Block analytics cookies, use a blocker, or the GA opt-out add-on to stop analytics capture.
